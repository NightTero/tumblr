# Rules

1. Real life comes first. I do this as a hobby. I can sometimes leave for months. It depends on my health.
2. I write in third person past tense or present tense.
3. I will probably contact you about plotting. I hate unplotted stuff. Unless it's a crack or humor thread.
4. If we’re mutuals, it’s kind of annoying to be the one to DM first, request a thread, come up with a plot, then be expected to write the first post. If I do all those things at least be the one to make the starter :/ Please make an effort.
5. I followed you because I want to interact! I DM you for a reason.
6. Please tag real-life politics, real-life social issues, and real-life age gaps, NSFW images, OOC posts, and crack threads.
7. No NSFW involving s*xual stuff.
8. Everything is tagged accordingly.
9. Equal effort is required from both muns.
10. I don't half-ass my replies so please don't do that to me.
11. I do one to four paragraphs but right now I only prefer one to two and even one-liners.
12. Please have your age somewhere on your blog.
13. I’m a sucker for platonic ships, and rivals to friends. I'm not a big fan of romantic ships.
14. I’m here to roleplay and to make friends, if you believe I did something wrong please tell me. I meant no harm.
15. I don’t send passwords no matter what.
16. You have permission to hurt my muse, but for permanent damage just give me a heads up.
17. My Discord is available to mutuals.
18. Don’t like or ask for a starter and not have a bio and rules page visible on your blog.
19. Don’t like or ask for a starter and have four lines or less for that original character’s biography. That’s too little information for me to work with. Canon characters are the exception.
20. If you no longer wish to roleplay with me please hard-block. If you are unfollowing for inactivity and don't mind me re-following once active then soft-block is fine.
21. If you want to know the reason why I blocked you just ask.
22. If you're one of those people who constantly post starter calls, interest trackers, have people like or fill them out and you *never* get to them or delete it just so we can stroke your ego, stay away from me.
23. Non roleplay blogs, I see you and I love you.
24. Mun is in their 20s and has terrible anxiety and depression. I also suffer from an e*ting d*sorder I understand how triggering this is and will never bring it up unless you are okay with it. But because of my ED my activity level tends to drop at times. I could be gone for weeks to more than a year.
